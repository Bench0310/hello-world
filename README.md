Just another repository

Turn around
Look at what you see
In her face the mirror of your dreams
Make believe I'm everywhere
Given in the lights
Written on the pages is
The answer to a neverending story

Reach the stars
Fly a fantasy
Dream a dream
And what you see will be
Rhymes that keep their secrets will
Unfold behind the clouds
But there upon a rainow is
The answer to a neverending story
